For version 24 of the application, a separate postgres container was created.
It was set up manually without any scripts, but we will have to automate that.
we also had the migrations done and gunicorn was taken out in the dockerfile.
maybe look into replacing it back in.

to do:
be able to have a volumes so data is persistent.
make sure this is able to run on production server.
have a script/entrypoint for the container
